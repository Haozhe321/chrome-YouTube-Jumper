# chrome-YouTube-Jumper
Jump to any part of a (long) YouTube video with precision to the seconds. 

How To:
1. Download the zip folder
2. Unzip the folder
3. Go to Google Chrome Options > More Tools > Extensions
4. In ``` chrome://extensions/```, check "Developer Mode"
5. Click "Load unpacked extension"
6. Go to the directory of the unzipped folder and upload. Now you are ready to go. 

Future Change(s):
* Jump to a part of a video by searching for keywords in the subtitles(similar to Ctrl-F in documents). Great for long lecture videos if you want to skip to the part where the lecture talks about a specific topic.
