# chrome-YouTube-Jumper
Jump to any part of a (long) YouTube video with precision to the seconds.
An extension for the precision minded folks, or anyone who likes to be fast.

Latest Changes:
* Jump to a part of a video by searching for keywords in the subtitles(similar to Ctrl-F in documents). Great for long lecture videos if you want to skip to the part where the lecture talks about a specific topic. When the ```prev``` and ```next``` button turn limegreen, it means the search is done and you can start jumping in the videos. 

Ctrl-J (Cmd-J for MAC) to open the extension. Key in the time you want, and press "Enter".  

How To:
1. Download the zip folder
2. Unzip the folder
3. Go to Google Chrome Options > More Tools > Extensions
4. In ``` chrome://extensions/```, check "Developer Mode"
5. Click "Load unpacked extension"
6. Go to the directory of the unzipped folder and upload. Now you are ready to go.
